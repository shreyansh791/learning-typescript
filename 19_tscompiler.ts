 *  tsc filename.ts --watch or tsc filename.ts -w
Above command will enable the watch mode and then compiler will compile the typescript files after saving the changes automatically.
watch mode keeps an eye on the file which we use in the command and whenever there are changes in the file and it gets saved, watchmode will automatically run the typescript compiler and we do not need to do it manually.
